<strong>SAGEFRAME INSTALLATION GUIDE</strong><br />
<strong>The secret to a successful install</strong> is getting the prerequisites right first before you start the install. If everything is prepared correctly first, installation is straightforward and painless!<br />
<strong>Installing SageFrame is easy if you know how</strong>, yet there are a large number posts on the SageFrame &quot;Install It!&quot; forum from people who are having installation problems ranging from basic to advanced.&nbsp; Why is this?&nbsp; The answer is that many first time installers do not get the prerequisites right before they start to install.<br />
<strong>This guide to SageFrame install prerequisites assumes that you have direct access to the computer</strong> - for those using a hosted account, instead of installing these prerequisites, just ask your hosting provider if these prerequisites are already set up for you, and if their control panel software will install SageFrame for you.<br />
<strong>You must first</strong> install these items, in the given order:<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Internet Information Server (IIS) .<br />
<strong>2.</strong> DotNet Framework 3.5 with Service Pack 1( SP1)<br />
<strong>3.</strong> SQL Server (Express or 2005 or 2008).<br />
<strong>4.</strong> If you are using SQL server express then you must also install SQL server management console for SQL server express (a separate download from microsoft.com).<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>There are 5 basic steps to a clean install.</strong><br />
<ol>
	<li>
		Download the .zip file from <a href="http://www.sageframe.com">www.sageframe.com</a> or <a href="http://sageframe.codeplex.com">http://sageframe.codeplex.com</a></li>
	<li>
		Create the database and a SQL Server login</li>
	<li>
		Create the website folder and unzip the downloaded .zip file.</li>
	<li>
		Create virtual directory in Internet Information Service(IIS) and configure the website</li>
	<li>
		Run the SageFrame installation&nbsp;wizard in your favorite web browser.</li>
</ol>
<strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Download the .zip file from www.sageframe.com.</strong><br />
After you have logged into www.sageframe.com, navigate to &ldquo;<strong>Downloads</strong>&rdquo;, select the desired the latest versions install package and save to your C: drive (for our example, I selected and downloaded the 2.1 INSTALL source code version (SageFrameV2.1_Source.zip). Installing the source code version of SageFrame allows you to make changes to the core code of SageFrame.<br />
<br />
<strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Create the Database, SQL Server Login, and Database User</strong><br />
There are two things you need to do in SQL Server Management Studio.&nbsp;First, create a database. Second,&nbsp;create the SQL Server login for that very same database. Make sure that your database server runs in &ldquo;<strong>mixed authentication mode</strong>&rdquo; (SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode&rdquo; is checked.) You can find this setting by right-clicking on&nbsp;your server (first node&nbsp;in the SQL Server Management Studio tree on the left), then <strong>Properties | Security</strong>.<br />
<strong>Create the Database </strong><br />
<ul>
	<li>
		Open SQL Server Management Studio</li>
	<li>
		Select your desired server from the drop-down list&nbsp;and connect</li>
	<li>
		Expand the tree on the left-hand side so you can see &ldquo;<strong>Databases</strong>&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		Right-click on &quot;<strong>Databases</strong>&quot;</li>
	<li>
		Select &ldquo;<strong>New Database</strong>&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		In the &quot;Database Name&quot; field, enter a name for your database and click OK. For this example, I entered &ldquo;SF21&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		You now have an empty database called SF21</li>
</ul>
<br clear="all" />
<strong>Creating a login for your database:</strong><br />
<ul>
	<li>
		Expand the Security node of your server</li>
	<li>
		Right-click on Logins</li>
	<li>
		Select &ldquo;<strong>New Login</strong>&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		Enter your desired login name. You must remember this login name and password as we will use it later. For my purposes here, I&rsquo;ve entered &ldquo;SF21Login&rdquo; (without the quotes) as my login name.</li>
	<li>
		Select &ldquo;<strong>SQL Server Authentication</strong>&rdquo; and enter a password. I entered &ldquo;test&rdquo; as my password.</li>
	<li>
		Uncheck &ldquo;<strong>Enforce Password expiration/User must change password at next login</strong>&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		Click &ldquo;<strong>User Mapping</strong>&rdquo; on the left</li>
	<li>
		Select/Check the new database you created in the top grid &ldquo;<strong>Users mapped to this login</strong>:&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		Select/Check db_owner in the bottom list &ldquo;Database role membership for: &ldquo;</li>
	<li>
		Click OK</li>
	<li>
		Now look in the Security node under your database (SF21) and you will see a newly created database user listed, meaning we also created a new database user by mapping our SQL Server login to our database.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>The database portion is now complete.</em></strong><br />
<strong>3</strong><strong>. Create the website folder and unzip the downloaded .zip file.</strong><br />
In this step, we create a folder and unzip the source code version SageFrame .zip package file to this directory. You can put it directly under C:\inetpub\wwwroot or C:\<em>foldername</em>. For this example, I used C:\SF21.<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		In Windows Explorer, create a new folder called SF200 on your C: drive. This will be the folder where your website files will live.</li>
	<li>
		Extract (unzip)&nbsp;the SageFrameV2.1_Source.zip file that you downloaded earlier into your desired folder (C:\SF200 in our example)</li>
	<li>
		Lastly, you must change the access permissions of your folder. The Windows account that is used to access your site must have full control over your SageFrame root folder. To set this, right-click on the root folder of your site (C:\SF21). Click Sharing and Security. Click the Security tab. If you do not see the Security tab, you must &ldquo;<strong>turn off</strong>&rdquo; simple file sharing for the folder. To do this, select the root folder (C:\SF21) in Windows Explorer. Click Tools | Folder Options. Select the View tab. Uncheck &ldquo;<strong>Use simple file sharing</strong>.&rdquo; Click OK. You can now right-click the folder and access the Security tab.</li>
	<li>
		On the Security tab, you will see a list of users who have access to your folder. Windows XP uses the ASPNET account and Windows 2003 uses the NETWORK SERVICE account. Add the account and give it full control permissions.</li>
</ul>
<strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>IIS &ndash; Create virtual directory and set-up</strong><br />
Now that the database and file system are in place, we can create the virtual directory in IIS.<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		Open IIS and expand the tree to see &ldquo;<strong>Default Web Site</strong>&rdquo;. (You can find IIS in Start | Control Panel | Administrative Tools.)</li>
	<li>
		Expand the &quot;<strong>Default Web Site</strong>&quot; node.</li>
	<li>
		If you have placed your SF root folder&nbsp;under C:\inetpub\wwwroot, you will already see your website and can bypass this step. If not, you will need to add a virtual directory.</li>
	<li>
		Right-click on &quot;<strong>Default Web Site</strong>&quot;</li>
	<li>
		Click <strong>New | Virtual Directory</strong></li>
	<li>
		Enter an alias &ndash; &quot;SF21&quot; will do</li>
	<li>
		Click Next and enter/browse to&nbsp;the path to the root folder of your website.</li>
	<li>
		Click Next and leave access permissions as is (should be set to Read/Run Scripts.)</li>
	<li>
		Click Next and Finish</li>
</ul>
Now that a virtual directory is in place, you&rsquo;ll need to modify its properties.<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		Click on the &quot;<strong>Documents</strong>&quot; tab</li>
	<li>
		An entry for &ldquo;<strong>Default.aspx</strong>&rdquo; needs to be added. Add default.aspx and move it to the top of the default documents list.</li>
	<li>
		Click on the &quot;<strong>Directory Security</strong>&quot; tab</li>
	<li>
		In the &ldquo;Anonymous access and authentication control&rdquo; group box, click &quot;<strong>Edit</strong>&quot;</li>
	<li>
		Make sure that &ldquo;<strong>Anonymous Access</strong>&rdquo; is checked as well as &ldquo;<strong>Integrated Windows Authentication</strong>&rdquo;</li>
	<li>
		Next, click on the &quot;<strong>ASP.NET</strong>&quot; tab and make sure that &ldquo;<strong>2.0.50727</strong>&rdquo; is select for the ASP.NET version</li>
	<li>
		Click OK to save your changes</li>
</ul>
<strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>Run the SageFrame installation&nbsp;wizard in your favorite&nbsp;web browser to complete the installation process.</strong><br />
The very last step is to initiate the SF install via a web browser. The install wizard takes over. In doing so, it creates tables and stored procedures in your database and adds the needed data rows to these tables to house your site. You will be prompted to test your folder&rsquo;s permissions, test the database connection and lastly, enter your desired user name and password for your host and admin user. Write these down!<br />
<ul>
	<li>
		Open your web browser of choice and navigate to <u>http://localhost/SF21</u> (replace SF21 with the name of your IIS virtual directory)</li>
	<li>
		If everything has been configured properly, you will be guided through an install wizard i.e. http://localhost/SF21/Install/InstallWizard.aspx.</li>
	<li>
		You will choose the custom install setting.&nbsp; We will not choose auto option, because the custom install allows us to specify the database information.&nbsp; Even though, the auto option will be disabled if it is your first and fresh SageFrame installation.</li>
	<li>
		&nbsp;If you are upgrading your previous version of SageFrame then the auto option will be enabled.</li>
	<li>
		Test your folder permissions when requested.</li>
	<li>
		Verify your database connection when asked.</li>
	<li>
		You will see the wizard running the script for each version after you click &quot;<strong>Next</strong>&quot;.</li>
	<li>
		On successful completion, click on &ldquo;<strong>Finish (Access your Portal</strong>)&rdquo; and your new SF-based website appear.</li>
</ul>
<em>If while installing, anything goes wrong due to missing any of the settings above, then delete the database and create a new empty database and start the SageFrame install again.&nbsp; The reason for this is that a half completed install will result in a half created database, and it is quicker to start again than it is to fix a half installed database. Otherwise if all settings are configured correctly as mentioned above steps, you should check for sqldataprovider .sql scripts files under folder</em> http://localhost/SF21/<em>Install/Providers/DataProviders/SqlDataProvider/</em><em> and rerun the .sql scripts by clicking &ldquo;Return&rdquo; button. </em>
<strong>6</strong><strong>.Default&nbsp; username and password</strong><br />
After&nbsp; the successful installation of SageFrame, you can access to the default login page of SageFrame as&nbsp; http://localhost/SF21/sf/sflogin.aspx(replace SF21 with the name of your IIS virtual directory).<br />
The Default username and password for the system are<br />
Password: superuser for Username: superuser<br />
Password: admin for username: admin<br />
